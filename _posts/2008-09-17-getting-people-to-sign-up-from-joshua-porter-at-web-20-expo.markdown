Joshua Porter (bokaro.com) gave a great presentation this morning at the Web 2.0 Expo in New York today.

Getting people to sign up on a site or app is difficult - there's a natural 'friction' that keeps people from signing up.

Real sign-up numbers from real companies:
<ul>
	<li>8.0%</li>
	<li>6.76%</li>
	<li>4.7%</li>
	<li>16.0%</li>
	<li>0.003%</li>
</ul>
Usability is of course one of the main factors affecting the sign-up rate. Â Gmail for instance has correct tab order, they end with "@gmail.com" so it's clear to the user what they're creating with a login name. Â Checking availability is also possible without a full submit. Â The password box tells the restrictions (6 characters) and check immediately. Â Security questions can be a real burden for people who are new to sign ups. Â Other questions like location also deter. Â "Letters are case sensitive" means very little to the common user. Â In other words, Gmail does a great job but not a perfect job.

Boston.com forces one to fill out virtually all fields. Â They do tell you what to do right on the page but the number of unnecessary data points becomes a burden - people don't want to put in what their job is just to get the paper. Â Instead of saying to the user, "We are using this info to customize the paper/ads for you", they say nothing. Â Even after all that, they want the user to sign up for newsletters and then for information from advertisers.

Improving the use of forms involves
<ul>
	<li>Â Reduce number of fields</li>
	<li>Pre-submit username check</li>
	<li>Password security right on the password input box</li>
	<li>Following conventions like having 'sign-in' on top right of screen</li>
	<li>Have a clear privacy policy</li>
</ul>
<div>But ... These issues are not 'sign-up'. Â Sign up is in the mind. Â Apathy is what drives people to not sign up. Â Are they motivated enough by what you're offering to care about filling out the form? Â "If ease of use were the only requirement, we would all be riding tricycles" (couldn't read the author).</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Eager Sellers, Stony Buyers" is a great article on buying. Â If you are a current user of software, you typically overvalue it by a factor of 3. Â If you are software maker trying to sell software by a factor of 3. Â They actually think it's 3 times better than it actually is. Â This is called the 9x effect whereby somebody who is already bought-in will experience a 9x overvaluation of the product when the seller is presenting it to them.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What we're asking of the user with sign-up isn't just to fill out a form, it's also asking somebody to change their behavior, give up accepted practices, jump into the unknown, trade known quantity for an unknown, and a "shift from potential to kinetic energy". Â </div>
<div></div>
<div>Motivation trumps the ease of use of the form.Â </div>
<div></div>
<div>We need to analyze what happens before the form.</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Product research</li>
	<li>Considering the alternative</li>
	<li>Learning about the product</li>
	<li>Comparison with existing products</li>
	<li>The user's current situation</li>
</ul>
<div>When you are the product creator or represent that company, you know much more about the product than the user who you're attempting to convince. Â We need to design for 3 visitor types.</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>I know I want to sign up (get out of the way).</li>
	<li>I want to make sure this is for me (Reiterate basic value proposition).</li>
	<li>I'm skeptical (convince with more thorough information).</li>
</ul>
<div>Geni.com Â has a great signup by having the user put the father's name and mother's name right into the signup form (they're a geneaology site). Â Immediately, this explains the purpose of the information and gets buy-in.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Netvibes.com is another site. Â If you haven't been there before (no cookie), you'll get an intro right off the bat. Â If you've been cookied (but not a member), you'll get more of the end information without the intro information. Â Another concept is that once you've created a page, there is a sign that says, "Don't lose your page, become a member now." Â That is superior to just 'Sign Up'.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Instant engagement is the first and most important thing. Â Show them what they're getting, don't describe or tell them.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Netflix is another great example. Â The main page tells you everything right there. Â "Sign up today and try Netflix for FREE!" with a whole bunch of other follow-up content and the form is right there. Â In addtion, at the bottom, they give 4 tiles with the entire process of dealing with the company: Pick movies, get movies in mail, no late fees, drop movie in the mailbox. Â This simple explanation is critical. Â The copy uses words like "your" to show that this is how you deal with the system and "we" so it's clear who is responsible for what. Â If none of that works, in the lower right there's a phone number and chat link for people that want more information.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tripit also has a 3 pane design showing how it works. Â They don't even ask for people to sign up off the bat. Â Just have people forward the emails from Orbitz and that's how they start the sign-in process. Â Movies and screencasts are also available - another great design element for this issue.</div>
<div></div>
</div>
</div>
<div>I won't go into the details about these sites that are poorly done: BillMyClients.com. Â In a redesign, it's even worse. Â The login is right on the home page but people who don't know how to get a login or what the site does don't know what to do. Â The login is best put in the top right. Â Also, the copy is really miserable - "Get a free email ..." Â The visual hierarchy is completely wrong. Â Blinksale.com, which does essentially the same thing has a much better sign up page (I think I'll have to check them out for invoicing). Â </div>
<div></div>
<div>Social Influence is the final piece of the sign up process. Â Basecamp does a great job with tons of testimonials from large brand publications and tastemakers and 'normal' people. Â Jaiku and Twitter make it real obvious that the whole world is on this, now, using it. Â Get press coverage on the web site. Â </div>
<div></div>
<div>In fine, motivation is everything.</div>
