A friend of mine was laid off yesterday.  He worked at a company doing enterprise search services for large organizations.  His focus was on the media industry in NY - which I guess isn't buying entreprise search as much as other industries.

I find this a bit disconcerting.  Hopefully for the city, that company had other problems.  It sounded like they didn't get the VC round they were hoping for and that's certainly an issue.  I'm surprised that a company at that stage wouldn't be cash flow positive.  They had well over 100 people.

If anybody needs work, let me know.  I run across good jobs sometimes.
