I found this funny line in the proxy statement of TTWO:

"The Sisters of St. Joseph of Nazareth, Michigan has submitted a stockholder proposal for consideration at the Annual Meeting..."

Basically, a convent is an investor in the producers of Grand Theft Auto and Bioshock :-)

I like their proposal though - cut out some of the fat cat pay until we see some performance improvements in the bottom line.
