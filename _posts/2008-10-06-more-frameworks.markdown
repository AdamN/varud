It's been a tough couple of days.Â  Well, I went to Providence, RI for the weekend, which isn't tough.Â  However, today and Friday, Patrick and I worked on some deeper technology issues and came to some conclusions:
<ol>
	<li>We will use <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> Lenny.Â  Lenny is just about to be declared stable and Etch is simply too old for what we need.</li>
	<li>We will use pretty much the defaults on Lenny although <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> will be version 1.0</li>
	<li>We will use Amazon Web Services as previously mentioned.</li>
	<li>The use of Django leads to another open issue - will we use Django at all?Â  Ruby/Merb is still in the running because <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">HAML</a> and <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html">SASS</a> look so exciting.</li>
	<li><a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a>.</li>
</ol>
So, we still have a competition between Ruby and Python.
