In a follow up to my previous post and others' about the New York startup scene, Gary's Guide has put together a <a title="NYCTech" href="http://www.garysguide.org/nyctech">fabulous central resource</a> for technology companies.Â  This is a fantastic site, and even better, it's not in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ny-tech/messages/4607435/">Flash</a>.

I recommend everybody to check it out.
