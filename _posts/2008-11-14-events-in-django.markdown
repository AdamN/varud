Being that I am creating a site tightly coupled with events and calendars, I need some event functionality.  There are three options:
<ol>
	<li>The event subsystem from<a href=" http://code.google.com/p/django-basic-apps/source/browse/#svn/trunk/events"> Django Basic Apps</a></li>
	<li>Somebody's self-maintained <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-event-calendar/">event app</a></li>
	<li>And ... the <a href="http://thauber.com/blog/post/django-schedule/">event system</a> that's in Pinax</li>
</ol>
Option 3 really is great.  What a great app written with some really good methods including Periods and Relations.  I'm very excited to use it.
