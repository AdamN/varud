This is from <a href="http://acsseo.com/">Neil Patel</a> - a smart, young branding guy

What is a social networking?Â  Social networking is not just about Facebook but also about social news, bookmarking, etc...

Social News - <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg.com</a> is a clear example of a site that allows users to 'create' the home page of news for specific people

Social Bookmarks - <a href="http://del.icio.us">Del.icio.us</a> allows users to publish and share their bookmarks.

Niches - There are many social networks and 'zones' for users to congregate: political, environmentalist, etc...Â  Marketing through those niches has to be respectful of the niche otherwise nobody will follow the trail.

Success:
<ul>
	<li> Learn to follow the rules - This helps out with your reputation which is critical to getting other's to vote for you</li>
	<li>Provide value through content - If the content doesn't apply to the end user, it won't work.Â  You can grease the wheels by helping the users (iPod for content), etc...</li>
	<li>Be a part of the community - You must be part of the ongoing community related to your product.</li>
</ul>
The thing is that social network marketing is more about improving your PageRank (through links and community referrals).Â  If you get a ton of uniques from Digg, it will help get density with relation to your competitors - helping to show that your site overall (even if only one article was linked to) is a quality site.
