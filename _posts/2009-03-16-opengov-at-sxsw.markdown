It might be a little late to blog about it - but this looks like a great event.  When I was still contemplating going to Austin, I had this in my list of things to check out - but then I decided not to go (save $$$/get things done) and didn't think about this until cleaning up my email.  Anyway, it starts in 2 hours for anybody out there:

-----
We (LoTV) are going to do Ignite style talks at lunch during SXSW
interactive.  I think this really is relevant to the Open Data group
because in MY opinion Open data is the key to open Govt.  Anyone wanna
talk about potential applications they are working on that are going
to SXSW?

We are an Official SXSW Event
We are an Official <a href="http://ignite.oreilly.com/" target="_blank">Ignite.oreilly.com</a> event
and we are an Official Sunshineweek.org event

They will be professionally videotaped and posted to multiple sites
afterwards in 5 min increments.

I would love it if you could blog about it?

1) to recruit people that are already attending SXSW
2) to highlight the projects coming
3) post the video links of "hot" projects afterwards?

It is 12:30 -2:00 Mar 16th
Fiddler's hearth
301 Barton Springs Rd
Austin, TX 78704

If you are coming to SXSW and have a project you would like to talk
about IGNITE style - 20 slides 15 seconds per slide (auto
forwarding)  Please let me know so we can put you on the schedule!

Thanks!
