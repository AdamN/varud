Ok, I had to get this on the site.  Cornify is the best thing since sliced bread.  This is the hot micromeme of the month ...

[UPDATE] Checking it out at <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=cornify">Twitter</a> is really interesting.  I think Clay Shirky was the first to really get it out there 2 days ago.  It's fun to see something this simply happy to make a move in the community.  It's also cool that it starts with a <a href="http://www.djangopony.com/">pony</a>
