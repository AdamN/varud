<ul>
	<li>Provide realtime feedbck for actions.</li>
	<li>Provide rewards.</li>
	<li>Provide objectives through quests.</li>
	<li>Level people up.</li>
</ul>
<div>A good site will notify the user that new content is available.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Give the user a taste before the signup.</li>
	<li>Facebook has a chat but it works very poorly.</li>
	<li>Quests to complete objectives (LinkedIn has the level the user is at so they put in more information)</li>
	<li>For forums, comments should show as 'new' in real time.</li>
	<li>Allow people to easily communicate with eachother (IRC on the content page)</li>
</ul>
<div>Problems with real time communication and data:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Concurrency - one problem is that if you show how many users are on a site, you'd be surprised how low it is - which makes it seem like nobody is there - a ghost town.</li>
	<li>Game breakers - if the game breaks, most people will simply leave forever. Â There isn't loyalty.</li>
	<li>Technical scale is an issues since online interaction increases exponentially with linear growth in users.</li>
	<li>Social problems include 'griefers' who just make life miserable by screwing with other people on the system. Â Racists, bigots, etc... Â In real time interaction, it's hard to have aggressive filters. Â The ability to leverage somebody's status against them helps though. Â If somebody has a status of 20, you can threaten termination for being a griefer.</li>
	<li>Race conditions are problems on real time sites - this is a design issue and probably isn't a major problem for social network coordination sites.</li>
	<li>Poor design that prevents easy initial use is a major problem.</li>
</ul>
