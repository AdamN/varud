I just got another one of these VC email solicitations for an 'exclusive event'.  At least youngStartup has the transparency to tell me upfront what the presentation fee is, but I find it disturbing that for $1,500 I can buy a "Top Innovator" award.  Varud.com has only ever been a blog.  About 2 years ago I worked on an idea for a social network based around future events and their outcomes - but it never materialized.  It certainly doesn't merit an award.  I'm surprised that people from Bain, etc.. could get suckered into attending an event like this.  Obviously, the best ideas won't be presenting here, only the ones with money to play.

Don't get me wrong, established companies pay to present all the time.  That's part of how they market.  However, a startup spending $1,500 for something like this either doesn't know what it's doing (much better to spend that money on your product or more strategic marketing) or isn't well run - or it's already well-funded.  Jason Calcanis has already written about this extensively.  His message is that there are plenty of free ways to get an audience for your ideas.  The most important thing is for you to have a partner whose skills complement your own and the time and money to work on your project.  If you don't have the partner, worry about that first.  If you have the partner and not the time and money, make your pitch awesome and then start pitching to whoever will listen - for free.  Just getting in front of user groups and meetups is a huge step.  At the same time, work on your product.  If, after 6 months, you're not getting any traction, step back and reevaluate everything from the ground up.

Note: In order to not make this an ad hominem attack, I've taken out the sender's name.
