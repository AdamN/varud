All,

I would just like to announce that a friend of mine, whose mother has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis">ALS</a>, is doing her fourth annual "Walk for Hope".Â  I encourage people to donate and to <a href="http://www.judyswalkforhope.com/?p=22">take part in the walk and the raffle</a>.Â  For those who are unfamiliar with the disease, I encourage you to watch "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/somuchsofast/">So Much So Fast</a>" which chronicles a family coming to grips with this heart-wrenching, life-changing ailment.
