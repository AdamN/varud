I just got this email from the CEO of Crowdspring asking me to vote for them for some upcoming awards.  Here are the links:

I really like what these guys in Chicago have done with this idea.  I voted for them and I hope they win.  Crowdspring epitomizes the intersection of crowdsourcing and expertise - which is where things are heading IMHO.

Here is the link to their post:
