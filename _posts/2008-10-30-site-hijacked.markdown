I'm not sure if anybody noticed, but the site was taken down for a few days because somebody defaced it.  I kind of liked the music that they put on my homepage, but after listening to the song, I had to go about fixing it.  What did I learn?
<ol>
	<li>Don't use shared hosts.  In this day and age, unless you are super poor, do not use a shared host.  If you are not technically savvy, use services for specific tasks (i.e. blogger.com for a blog) so you don't have to think about the technology/maintenance.  If you are technically savvy and you have needs that are not basic, get a server where you have root access.  <a href="http://amazonaws.com/ecw">AWS ec2</a> is awesome for this.  The cost is $75 a month though so it may be too expensive for some people (although if you can set one up - I can probably find a gig for you to make enough money to pay that $75/month - just drop me a line).</li>
	<li>Dreamhost.com, while pretty good and having good customer service, just isn't what I need.  People have recommended <a href="http://www.gandi.net/">gandi.net</a> for name services and hosting if you need the cheap option for hosting.  I haven't used it personally but knowledgeable people love them.</li>
</ol>
Oh, I don't think I've done an update on platform choices either.  Here is where I stand now:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> 5.0.45 (I'm still contemplating PostgreSQL)</li>
	<li><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> 2.5.1</li>
	<li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> 2.2.9</li>
	<li><a href="http://fedoraproject.com">Fedora</a> 8 (I like the Fedora/Red Hat series - Debian/Ubuntu was giving me grief).</li>
	<li><a href="http://djangoproject.org">Django</a> 1.0</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.pinaxproject.com">Pinax</a> trunk</li>
</ol>
That was fun!  I feel very excited about the Python community.  It's a smaller group but it's growing fast and it has solid support out there.  In addition, it's a rock solid language with full unicode support - I love that.
