I wasn't looking for it, but this might be the <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/100/safeinfo.fun">oldest reference to</a> electronic communication paths as "pipes".  This history page of the <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/100/">top 100 posts</a> of the BBS era has a bunch of examples like that.

I presume the history of using the word "pipes" in a communication sense comes from the actual use of pipes to talk between two floors in a building or on a <a href="http://www.bsaverof.com/uk/NewsDet.asp?pid=58">ship</a>.  Even as recently as the 40s, talking throug pipes was more reliable for short range communication than electric lines.
